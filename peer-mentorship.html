      <h2>Madrassa–School Peer Mentorship Program</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">Bridging traditional Islamic education with modern knowledge, bringing Madrassa and school students together for mutual learning and growth.</p>

      <div class="program-detail" style="background:var(--white); border-radius:16px; padding:28px; box-shadow:var(--shadow);">
        <h3>What This Program Is About</h3>
        <p>This innovative program brings Madrassa students and school/college students together for mutual learning and peer mentorship. It creates a structured space where both groups learn from each other, breaking down barriers between traditional and modern education while developing balanced leaders with strong Islamic identity and contemporary skills.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Madrassa Students Share:</strong> Islamic studies, Quran recitation, Arabic language, Hadith, Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), ethics, moral reasoning, and spiritual guidance</li>
          <li><strong>School/College Students Teach:</strong> Digital skills, communication and presentation skills, English language, mathematics, science, general awareness, and technological literacy</li>
          <li><strong>Peer Mentoring Model:</strong> Both groups serve as mentors to each other in their respective areas of expertise, creating reciprocal learning relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Why This Program Is Necessary & Important</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Addressing the Gap:</strong> Many Madrassa students lack exposure to technology, communication skills, and modern subjects essential for contemporary life and careers.</li>
          <li><strong>Bridging Knowledge Divide:</strong> School students often have no structured understanding of Islamic scholarship, classical reasoning, ethics, or spiritual development.</li>
          <li><strong>Breaking Stereotypes:</strong> This program destroys misconceptions and biases between traditional and modern education advocates.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrated Development:</strong> Develops a balanced generation that understands both Deen (Islamic faith) and Dunya (worldly affairs), creating holistic human beings.</li>
          <li><strong>Mutual Respect:</strong> Fosters genuine respect, understanding, and collaboration between different educational backgrounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Confident Muslim Leadership:</strong> <strong>Strong identity + strong skills = confident Muslim leaders</strong> equipped to serve their communities effectively.</li>
